OOPS:
=>Constructor Calling:
//Constructor: It is a Special Methodin the class , that Intializes the state of an Object.
// Simply, Constructor: Constructor means Initialization of Object.

Intialization means you are calling the default constructor it create objects.
//when we call the constructor of child class , it atomatically cass the Parent Constructor:

ex: 

class Animal{
  Animal(){
    System.out.println("Animal Constructor);
  }
}
class Dog{
  Dog(){
    System.out.println("Dog Constructor);
  }
}
  class Main
       {
          public static void main(String args[])
          {
              new Dog();
      
          }
    
       }

    //when we call the constructor of child class , it atomatically cass the Parent Constructor: so,
                       the output will be:

                       Animal Constructor.
                       Dog Constructor.
-------------------------------------------------------------
=>Method Calling:

//When we call a method of a class, only that class method will get Execute , Super method Wont Execute.       
                       
class Animal{
  static void eat(){
    System.out.println("Animal is eating);
  }
}
class Dog{
  static vois eat(){
    System.out.println("Dog is Eating);
  }
}
  class Main
       {
          public static void main(String args[])
          {
               Animal.eat(); //outpu: Animal is Printing
               Dog.eat();  //outpit: Dog is Printing
      
          }
    
       }   

=>Here we are not creating objects of Animal or Dog , beacuse  those are static methods.
=> we can call the static methods of a class Directly, beacuse , the method is static.
 => Static means nothing but , it is a Class instance. not an Object instance.

=>Coditional Statements:
                       
It will the Check the Given Condition and it will print that Block.
                       
Types:
* if
        //In if , it check the condition , if it is correct then enter into the block and executes the Statements inside the Block.
    Syntax: if(Condition)
            {
            //Statements.
            }
    Example:
          //Find the Greatest Number.
                       
           if(a>b)
            {
            System.out.println("a is Greater");
            }
                       
* if else
          //In if else , it check the condition of if() block, if it is correct then enter into the if block and executes the Statements inside the Block. or 
                       //if condtition not satisfies it will enter into Else block and it will print it.
    Syntax: if(Condition)
            {
            //Statements.
            } 
             else
               {
                //Statements

                }

          Example:
          //Find the Greatest Number.
                       
           if(a>b)
            {
            System.out.println("a is Greater");
            }
          else
          {                
          System.out.println("b is Greater");
           }
                       
*if , else if,else(if else Lader)
        // it is ued to check multiple conditions.
                       
*Switch 
     // it is also used to check multiple Conditions based on cases.It is most useful when we have multiple Conditions.
