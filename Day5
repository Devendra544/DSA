**** Arrays ***

=> Array is a data Structure , that is used to store multiple data of same type in an contiguous memeory location is called Array.
=> we cant store multiple type of data in a single array:
      arr={10,'c',"Strin",10.2};
=> we cant store only same type of data: {1,2,3,4,5} or {"deva","Mahesh","sunil"};

=>all the Data of the array will store in Heap Memory.
=> all the variables or refernce of that is stored in Stack Memory.

=> Contiguous Memory means, if 1st element is stores in 100 then 2nd element in 104 and 3rd is 108 , because the size in int is 4.
